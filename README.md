# 🌾 AgriGuard

> **Agricultural intelligence for Uganda** — crop price conveyance, crop price forecasting (using quant strategies), market intelligence, and weather insights & forecasts for smallholder farmers, delivered via a mobile app (Android and iOS), a desktop app (Windows and Linux), and a USSD interface for feature phones.

Built by **Keith Ndiema Kissa** (2025/BCS/101/PS) · Mbarara University of
Science and Technology, Uganda

## Objectives

AgriGuard exists to serve four things, and nothing else:

1. **Crop price conveyance** — get price data to farmers on whatever device they have (app, desktop, or a feature phone via USSD)
2. **Crop price prediction / forecasting** — XGBoost and Prophet forecasting per crop and market
3. **Market intelligence** — cross-market comparisons, arbitrage signals, biggest movers, national summaries
4. **Weather insights & forecasts** — historical and forecast weather, conveyed alongside price signals

## Status at a glance

| Layer | State |
|---|---|
| FastAPI backend — forecasts, markets, USSD | **Working.** Wired into `main.py`, backed by the committed WFP CSV. |
| Streamlit dashboard | **Working.** Reads from the backend over HTTP. |
| Price forecasting (XGBoost / Prophet) | **Working**, trainable via `scripts/train_models.py`. |
| `prices` router (CRUD price observations, MySQL-backed) | **Not wired in.** See Known Issues. |
| Weather data collection | **Working as a standalone script**, not yet joined into the forecasting features. See `data/README.md`. |
| `scripts/validate_data.py` | **Working.** Run it directly: `python scripts/validate_data.py --weather-dir data/processed/weather`. |
| `quant/` package | **Working, fully tested.** Backtesting, prediction intervals (empirical + conformal), and risk metrics — shared discipline with [Vestora](https://github.com/Ve-stora/vestora)'s quant module. `pytest quant/tests/` passes. |
| `mobile/` (Flutter), `desktop/` (Tauri), `shared/api-client/` | **Working.** Forecast, market-intelligence, and alerts screens wired to the FastAPI backend; not yet built/packaged for distribution. |

This section exists so the rest of the README doesn't have to hedge every
claim — anything described below as working, is working; anything listed
above as scaffold is described that way in its own section too.

## Problem

Ugandan farmers face some (if not all) of these compounding challenges:

- **Price blindness** — no reliable way to know if today is a good day to sell
- **Market fragmentation** — price gaps between markets go unexploited because farmers lack data
- **Unpredictable weather** — made worse by information gaps

## Solution

| Module | What it does | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Price Conveyance** | Delivers current and predicted prices to farmers over whatever channel they have | App (mobile/desktop) for internet-enabled devices, USSD for feature phones |
| **Price Forecasting** | Predicts crop prices weeks ahead, per market | XGBoost on WFP price history, Prophet as an alternative single-series forecaster |
| **Market Intelligence** | Cross-market comparisons, biggest movers, national summary | FastAPI serving the WFP dataset with trend analytics |
| **Weather Insights & Forecasts** | Current and historical weather, and a 14-day forecast, per market | Open-Meteo, surfaced in the app alongside price data |

Accessible via an **app** for internet-enabled devices and a **USSD interface** for feature phones
(`/ussd/simulate` locally; a real short-code requires an Africa's Talking
account).

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and set up environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agri-Guard/AgriGuard.git
cd AgriGuard
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp config/.env.example config/.env
# edit config/.env — everything has a working dev default
```
See `config/README.md` for the full variable reference and how config
resolution/precedence works.

### 3. Get data and train models

```bash
python scripts/download_wfp_data.py      # writes data/raw/wfp_food_prices_uga.csv
python scripts/train_models.py           # trains XGBoost -> ml/models/
```
See `data/README.md` for the dataset schema, provenance, and what's
git-ignored vs. committed.

### 4a. Run with Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
- Dashboard: http://localhost:8501
- API docs:  http://localhost:8000/docs

To force fresh data + model training first: `docker-compose --profile train run --rm trainer`.

### 4b. Run natively, no Docker

```bash
./run.sh            # sets up venv, installs deps, copies config/.env, runs both services
./run.sh --setup    # also runs download_wfp_data.py + train_models.py first
```

### 4c. Run manually

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd frontend && streamlit run Home.py --server.port 8501
```

## ML Methodology

### Price Forecasting (XGBoost)

**Features:** temporal (year, month, week, day-of-year, cyclic month
encoding), lag prices (1m, 3m, 6m), 3-month rolling average, label-encoded
crop and market.

**Training split:** 80/20 time-ordered (no data leakage).

**Metrics** (see `ml/models/metrics.json` after training — an append-only
run history, not a single snapshot):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| MAE | ~120 UGX/kg |
| MAPE | ~8% |
| R² | ~0.91 |

Prophet is used as an alternative for single-series forecasting and as a
confidence-interval reference. `notebooks/` documents a more ambitious
tiered (7/14/30/60–90 day) backtested version of this pipeline that hasn't
been promoted into `scripts/train_models.py` yet — see `notebooks/README.md`.

Issues before wiring it in.

## Data Sources

- **[WFP VAM Food Prices — Uganda](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices-for-uganda)** (HDX, open license) — historical crop prices, 10 markets, 8 commodities, 2018–present. Live-synced every `WFP_SYNC_INTERVAL_HOURS` — see `backend/app/services/wfp_sync.py`.
- **[FEWS NET Data Warehouse (FDW)](https://fdw.fews.net/api/marketpricefacts.csv?country_code=UG)** — supplementary, fresher-cadence Uganda market price feed blended on top of WFP wherever the two overlap (FEWS NET wins on overlap). Free, no account required for public data. Live-synced every `FEWS_NET_SYNC_INTERVAL_HOURS` — see `backend/app/services/fews_net_sync.py` and [API docs](https://help.fews.net/fdw/fews-net-api).
- **[Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com)** — free daily weather + 16-day forecast, no API key required, currently 8 of 10 markets covered

Full schema, provenance, and refresh commands: `data/README.md`.

## Known Issues

Kept here instead of silently fixed, so anyone picking this up knows what's
real vs. aspirational:

- **`prices` router is implemented but not wired into `main.py`.** It depends
  on `database.py` / `services/price_service.py` / `models/price.py`, which
  assume a MySQL-backed deployment this `docker-compose.yml` doesn't provision
  a service for. `DATABASE_URL` falls back to SQLite for dev, which the
  `aiomysql` driver in `requirements.txt` doesn't target — reconcile before
  wiring this router in. It also imports from a nonexistent top-level `app`
  package (should be `backend.app`) — fix that alongside the DB reconciliation.
- **`scripts/validate_data.py` — no longer an issue.** It's fully implemented
  (schema checks, price-bound sanity checks, weather-file validation) and
  passes on the committed datasets. Run it before training:
  `python scripts/validate_data.py --weather-dir data/processed/weather`.
- **Weather data isn't joined into the forecasting features yet.** Collected
  by `scripts/fetch_weather.py`, documented in `data/README.md`, but no
  training or inference code reads it.
- **`quant/`, `mobile/`, `desktop/`, `shared/api-client/` — no longer
  scaffolds.** All four are implemented: `quant/` has backtesting,
  prediction intervals, and risk metrics with a passing pytest suite;
  `mobile/` and `desktop/` are wired to the live FastAPI backend for
  forecasts, market intelligence, and alerts. None have been built into a
  distributable binary/APK yet — that's still open.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Wire the `prices` router in behind a real MySQL service, or drop it
- [ ] Join weather data into the price-forecasting feature set
- [ ] SMS push alerts via Africa's Talking (price conveyance)
- [ ] District-level food security index
- [ ] Build/package `mobile/` and `desktop/` for distribution (APK, MSI/AppImage)
- [ ] Multi-country expansion (Kenya, Tanzania)
